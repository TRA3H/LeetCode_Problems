# My Journal of Leet Code Problems 

Thought of just putting my progression on Github with all my thoughts and notes as I am grinding out all the problems.
Starting this grind I, feeling a bit motiviated to unmotivated I wanted to build a good coding habit so I started this journey just documenting problems as I go. Since I am break from school for the summer, I thought I take this opportunity to improve my self and boost my chances in getting my foot into my career lets get it. My goal has been to do at least 1 - 4 problems a day either in my bed or on my desktop whatever gets the problems done.

## Week 1

### The beginning

<!-- Add content related to Week 1 below this line -->
So far I have done Contains Duplicate, Valid Anagram, Two Sum, Group Anagrams and I have just been brute forcing my whole way through these problems. They were labeled as Easy so I wanted to challenge myself going through these problems without help. the Group Anagrams was a medium problem so I did need help but I learned how to use a hash map. What I learned from this:
1. create the map as a result (i used some defualtdict and made it into a list as a result)
2. enter through the abitrary list of strings
3. we create the map of set of keys i.e for the problem I did we mapped all the letters in the alphabet count = [0] * 26
4. looped through that string and counted the frequency of the character that appeared and matched the strings using a tuplet and appened it to our result

Still kind of fishy and learning how to use hash maps but so far this has been my progress
